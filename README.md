# DEDC-IMAE
DEDC-IMAE implement

This is code that accompanies the paper titled "DEDC-IMAE: a deep evolutionary document
clustering model with inherited mixed autoencoder" by Hui Lu Ruizhang Huang etc. 

The DEDC-IMAE model combines the strengths of existing topic-model based evolutionary document clustering and deep neural network. Each document is semantically represented with regard of a  mixture of underlying topics, learnt by a novel inherited mixed autoencoder(IMAE). The DEDC-IMAE learns evolutionary cluster partitioning and discover evolving document structures for dynamic document dataset.

Dependencies
The major project dependency are :

python 3.6.7
pytorch 1.1.0




Datasets
Adaptable to all evolved text datasets.

To Run
pretrain->IMAE
trainâ€”>DEDC
